excrpt: Iridium's first constellation had a quirk that turned into a phenomenon. Find out how satellites became artificial shooting stars that inspired a generation.
---
In the late 1990s, Iridium launched a constellation of 66 satellites into space, paving the way for the future of satellite communications. From Earth, unexpected reminders of the constellation’s presence appeared – Iridium Flares, a streak of light in the sky caused by sunlight reflecting off the main mission antenna of an Iridium® satellite. These Flares, which could be seen anywhere in the world, inspired a generation of global sky-watchers and created a cultural phenomenon. Over the years, “Flare-catchers” dedicated websites and social media accounts to tracking each of the Iridium satellites as they flashed across the sky.

Then, in the 2010s, we conducted largest constellation replacement program in history, known as Iridium® NEXT. This program replaced every first-generation satellite with newer, more capable ones, unlocking more potential for the Iridium network than ever before. As the new network was built, the original satellites were carefully deorbited. With them, these satellites took their Iridium Flares. As we said goodbye to the original Iridium constellation, Iridium Flare fans joined us in saying #flarewell to the original satellites and shared some of their favorite images with us!

### The World-Wide ‘Catch The Iridium’ Project
Iridium Flare fan Samuele Pinna created Catch the Iridium, a fan website for Flare enthusiasts around the world to help create a photo collection of Flares from every first-generation satellite.

### Meet the World’s Greatest Iridium Flare Catcher
After learning about Iridium Flares by chance, Ira Mollay became the world’s most dedicated Iridium Flare catcher through the end of the magnificent phenomenon.

> “Iridium Flares became a passion of mine in 2012 after I had serendipitously learned about them at a dinner party. I needed to find out how to spot them. Soon after, I did not let a single opportunity pass by to see one of those beautiful shining wonderworks that touched me so deeply.”

### An Iridium Flare Love Story
Long-time Iridium Flare watcher Paul Kearney wrote shared a heartwarming story of how an Iridium Flare brought him and his wife together when they first started dating!

> Good Day Iridium,

> I’ve read with a sense of considerable melancholia – and more than a wistful twinge – the story of the end of the first-generation Block 1 Iridium satellites. Thank you for sharing so many details of the new constellation, as well as the deorbits of the 66 “old guard” satellites.
> I have been a dedicated Iridium Flare watcher for over 15 years, and have had the good luck to observe them from such diverse areas as Norway, Belgium, Turkey, many areas of the U.S., and of course my home country, Canada.

> The marvelous lady who agreed to be my wife was new to the Iridium Flare world when we were dating. She lived several hundred kilometers from me at the time, so I thought I’d show her what these things were all about! We actually set up a “Flare date” whereby I calculated the time and location of a flare in her area and then got up early with her (she in Ontario and I in New Brunswick, Canada) and she reported her sight of the flare to me. Hey – it’s a bit unorthodox for some, but it worked for us! The great circle distance between the two spots that we viewed the Flare together was just shy of 912 kilometers, and if I recall correctly, she had a -7 magnitude, while mine was considerably less bright.

> Since then, we’ve watched dozens of Iridium Flares together, and we always remember that first special one!

> It is the end of an era for you, but not for us: we’ll continue sharing the night sky together, hopefully for many years to come. But, we’ll miss your Flares. Good luck as the new generation comes into service! #flarewell

### Our Long-Standing Commitment to Space
As a leader in the satellite communications industry and operator of the world’s preeminent Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, Iridium is committed to both ensuring the sustainability of LEO in the future and serving as the leading example of what it means to be a responsible steward of space.

For these reasons, we carefully deorbited the first-generation Iridium constellation as part of the Iridium NEXT satellite replacement program. When approaching retirement, each original satellite was put on an ‘end-of-life’ plan that carefully choreographed the time and location of its decommissioning, leading to its eventual disintegration in Earth’s atmosphere. By doing so, we maintained the highest standards of space debris mitigation and helped ensure the sustainability of space for the future.
